<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Warrensburg MO</h3>
<p>This is a totally legitimate question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, of course, as important as your hot water heater, water line, or drains. Nevertheless, it adds a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small round device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers carry just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
