The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
