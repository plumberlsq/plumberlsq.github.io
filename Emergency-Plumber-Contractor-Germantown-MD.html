<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
