The pipes can end up being brittle, gradually, and may need replacement quicker than hoped.

<p>A freshly installed water heater should not produce unusual noises, but it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder gradually as the heater runs to warm the water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be essential.</p>
