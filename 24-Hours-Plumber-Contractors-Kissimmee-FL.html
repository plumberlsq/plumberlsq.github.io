I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
