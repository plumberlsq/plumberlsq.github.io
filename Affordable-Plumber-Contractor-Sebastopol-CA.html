<p>Standpipe systems are used in many facilities, these systems are created to offer water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets strategically set up inside a structure. These systems normally are installed in large, open areas within structures, and in multistory structures for the purpose of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these buildings making it capable for a single individual or firefighter to offer a efficient and quick reaction to fire. There are two kinds of standpipe systems, the first type, are dry systems, which generally consist of no long-term water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire workers responding to an incident. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention security. The 2nd type is a damp standpipe system which is typically linked to the buildings safe and clean water supply and needs the installation of a check valve assembly.</p>
<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
