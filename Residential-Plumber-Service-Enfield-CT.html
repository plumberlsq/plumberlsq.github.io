The effectiveness of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Houses that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not want to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>For a garbage disposal with a factory-installed cord, simply plug in to the outlet under your sink after finishing the remainder of the actions. 106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General.
