Backflow is the unwanted flow of water or other liquids, mixtures, gasses or substances into the drinking water supply. In the majority of states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any natural gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your home or business. Atmos Energy does not preserve the natural gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical wiring and water pipes.</p>
<p>Gas lines in need of repair or replacement are incredibly unsafe to the house. Since gas by nature is an odor free substance, have a look at these 4 ways that you can begin to figure out if your home is experiencing a gas leak. Analysis and treatment seemed honest.

An RPBA works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be utilized to separate health or non-health risks.</p>
