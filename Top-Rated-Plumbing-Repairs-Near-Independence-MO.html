<p>Backflow preventers must just be repaired when the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has deteriorated in its performance listed below the established minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if essential, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
