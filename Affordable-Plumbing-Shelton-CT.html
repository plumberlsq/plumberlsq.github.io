While there's not a precise timetable as to when you must repipe your home, you ought to definitely check out repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- specifically if you reside in an older home developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe what exactly was wrong with the system, how he fixed the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would extremely suggest Hunter for any concerns you may have.</p>
<p>While the costs to repipe a home differs with each task and throughout the United States, it will generally cost $600 to $2,000 to repipe a single function (toilet, tub, etc.) and you can expect to pay anywhere from $4,000 to $15,000 for a complete piping system replacement. More serious cross-connection dangers might require a special kind of backflow preventer that can immediately discharge possibly polluted water before it gets in the public water system.

We highly recommend repiping your house during spring or summertime so you do not have to fret about freezing temperature levels during the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment.
