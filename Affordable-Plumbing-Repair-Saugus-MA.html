<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
