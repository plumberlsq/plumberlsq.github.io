An approved, properly installed and preserved backflow assembly essentially removes the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any substantial modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
