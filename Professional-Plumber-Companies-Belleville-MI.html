<p>Gas lines inevitably need repairs-- age and use will eventually use them down. Though normal, it's still stressful to a house owner, who may fear the inconvenience of hiring a service professional to manage their (possibly) pricey repairs rapidly and efficiently. That's what Mr. Rooter Plumbing is here for. Our inspections ensure you are aware of every potential gas line issue, and our repairs make sure your system is working completely again.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may need to look into using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
