<p>Lubrication may help with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the technician put together the components into the body without creating damage from friction. The lube must be a food grade lubricant to assure the water system is not contaminated. Oftentimes the best lube is water. The usual usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly lubed to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of excessive lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out sooner by drawing in dirt and debris or restricting the motion of the element. The appropriate quantity of lube should make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never see pieces or globs of lubricant.</p>
