<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>

Higher horsepower: Horse power (HP) measures how powerful a garbage disposal is. Garbage disposal HP ranges from 1/3 to 1, but for most single-family houses a 1/2 or 3/4 HP system will work simply great. If you have a big family or do a lot of cooking, you may think about a 1 HP garbage disposal.</p>
