These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units.

As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
