<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
