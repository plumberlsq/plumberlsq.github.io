<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Brighton MA</h3>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange.

When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
