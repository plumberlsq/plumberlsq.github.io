<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
