As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous desired usages around your home.</p>
