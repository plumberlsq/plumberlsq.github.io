Bell Cow is your reliable local plumber and sink repair professional-- from fast fixes to structural repair, we do it all.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
