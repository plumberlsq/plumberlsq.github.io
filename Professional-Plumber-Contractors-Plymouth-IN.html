<p>With time, kitchen drains can run more gradually and ultimately clog as greases, soaps, cleaning agents and fats build up inside pipes.

As a leader in drain cleaning company and sewer cleaning, you can count on Roto-Rooter's experience to resolve your kitchen drain problems.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). Examine the instructions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
