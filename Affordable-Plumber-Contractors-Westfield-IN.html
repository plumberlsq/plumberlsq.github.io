<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
