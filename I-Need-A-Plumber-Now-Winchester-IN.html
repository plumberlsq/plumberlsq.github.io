<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the method laid out above. Since the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
