<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
