<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel.
