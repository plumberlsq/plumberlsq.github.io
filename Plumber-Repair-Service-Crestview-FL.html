Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal cations in tough water The resulting soft water requires less soap for the very same cleaning effort, as soap is not wasted bonding with calcium ions. Soft water also extends the life time of plumbing by reducing or removing scale accumulation in pipes and fittings.
