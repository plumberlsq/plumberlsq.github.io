Fritz was in and out of the house within 30 minutes and he guarantees that the sink will stay clog-free for 30 days. If it obstructs once again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are extremely delighted that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly utilize this company again and once again in the future.</p>
