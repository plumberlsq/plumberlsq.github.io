<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to identify if and in some cases where a leak has actually happened in systems which consist of liquids and gases. Many steamfitters, pipefitters, and plumbers learn their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, as well as some technical direction, each year. Technical direction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and policies, and plan reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and companies. Most apprentices enter a program directly, but some start out as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
