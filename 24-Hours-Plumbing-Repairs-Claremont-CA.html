<p>If  you're tired of living with the side-effects of hard water, a water softening system from RainSoft can provide you with the service you need. Since we first opened in 1953, our water softeners have actually made a difference in the lives of countless house owners in The United States and Canada and all over the world. Our premium system, the EC4 whole house water softener, is a state-of-the-art product that utilizes a process of ion exchange to eliminate the minerals that trigger difficult water. By replacing the bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium ions that cause water solidity with sodium or potassium ions, the EC4 softens hard water by resolving its source. Additionally, thanks to its unique, integrated microprocessor, the EC4 system will discover your typical water usage patterns, adjusting its soft water shipment based upon your requirements. In this method, our premium water softener makes sure that you'll have an endless supply of soft water whenever you need it.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Difficult water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
