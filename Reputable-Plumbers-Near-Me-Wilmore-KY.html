<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regenerated, the beads become loaded with salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these signs.</p>
