Light-weight products and compact building devices reduce the cost of repair and lessen ecological damage.

<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and provide cleansed water. The energy source needed to heat the water is cheaper. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water solidity can be removed relatively easily by utilizing an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the firmness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally restored.</p>
