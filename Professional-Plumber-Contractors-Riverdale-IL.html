The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to add sodium to the water. This is a more heart environmentally friendly and healthy system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and use no drainage, no salt and no electrical power or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are extremely low maintenance because the media can last approximately five years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a monthly basis.</p>
