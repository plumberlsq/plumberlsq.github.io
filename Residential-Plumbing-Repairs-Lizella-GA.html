Backflow is the unwanted circulation of water or other liquids, mixtures, gasses or substances into the drinking water system. In the majority of states, except Kansas, you are accountable for any natural gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or organisation. Atmos Energy does not keep the gas lines on your home beyond our meter, this is the very same as other energies, such as your electrical circuitry and water pipes.</p>

As a homeowner or business owner, those reassurances can be really, extremely great to hear. We service pipelines throughout the state of Georgia, from Atlanta to Athens, Savannah to Augusta, Macon to Marietta, GA, and beyond.

<p>Get rid of the locknut that holds the toilet valve to the tank. Lower carefully on the valve as you unscrew the nut. Take out the old valve. Replacing the pipes in your house is necessary for preserving a healthy working water supply and an overall optimal home plumbing system.
