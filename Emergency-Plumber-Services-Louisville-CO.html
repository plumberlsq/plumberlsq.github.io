Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
