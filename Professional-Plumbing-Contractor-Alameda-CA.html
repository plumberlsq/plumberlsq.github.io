<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different style from the one we show, inspect the directions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
