The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline.

This assembly likewise enables the closure of one valve to decrease the pressure differential across the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even small backflow leakage. Test cocks, or small ball valves, enable the attachment of testing devices that examines whether the check assembly is practical.</p>
