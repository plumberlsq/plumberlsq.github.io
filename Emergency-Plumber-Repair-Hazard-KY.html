<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To prevent this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You might need to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
