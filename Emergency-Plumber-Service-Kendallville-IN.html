<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and go with a patching task instead of a repiping job, simply remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the exact same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your whole home when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
