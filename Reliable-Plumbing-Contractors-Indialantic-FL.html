<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the beginning of our house improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific requirements for our house. I will always utilize them and ask for George particularly for all future issues or repairs. They were prompt and provided excellent prices for what we needed done. I extremely recommend this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Things Pushed in Disposal. From flatware to large pieces of food, objects frequently get jammed in the waste disposal unit. With soapy water covering the disposal, sometimes it can be challenging to see what gets captured. Never attempt to eliminate the things or it will get stuck even further. Contact Winters House Services right away to sufficiently eliminate the things. Excavation: If the pipe is hard to gain access to, it can cost $1,000 to $5,000 to get to the leak due to excavation costs.</p>
