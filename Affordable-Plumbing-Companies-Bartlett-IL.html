Conventional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative effect on people with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no waste water, no electricity and no salt or chemicals.
