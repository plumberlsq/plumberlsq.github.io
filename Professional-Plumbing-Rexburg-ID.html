The pipes can become brittle, with time, and might need replacement faster than hoped. Some states require pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may likewise need an unique license to work on gas lines. Licensing generally needs a test or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.</p>
<p>There are a couple of indicators that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your house, and it is essential to take notice of them. The gas pipe may be pierced or damaged if you observe a strong odor that resembles rotten eggs. You may also hear a hissing noise as the gas is getting away from the line, but that isn't constantly the case. It is crucial to take action quickly to avoid any serious problems and to keep everyone safe if you smell rotten eggs.</p>
