The best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The appropriate backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
