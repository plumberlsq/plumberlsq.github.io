<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
