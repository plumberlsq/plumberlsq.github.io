<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance.

That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
