We remedy little leakages without repiping, but if you experience chronic leak or a slab leak, it might be time for a complete plumbing overhaul.</p>

The proposal to differ the code is sent in duplicate, in composing or with understandable drawings, and mentions the reason for deviation. The proposition might be considered and approved, if it fulfills the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
