<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel.
