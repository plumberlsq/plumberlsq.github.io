Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
