Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
