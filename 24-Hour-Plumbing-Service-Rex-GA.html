Still, as in lots of things in life, problems take place and need attention.</p>

The city or Uruk includes the earliest known examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had exchangeable and quickly removable sectors, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
