<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As difficult water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to lower these signs.</p>
<p>Regrow your softener with potassium chloride instead of salt chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is readily available at most shops that sell softener salt. Because the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less area. Clogged clog and drainage problems may start as small concerns however can quickly accelerate into substantial concerns. A clogged drain can even lead to slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>
