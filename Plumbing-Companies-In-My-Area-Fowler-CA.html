<p>Sodium consumption from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological reasons demand restricting salt, replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be proper. In time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has three cycles: rinse, recharge and backwash. The regeneration process can be arranged immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>An authorization and inspections are required for most residential jobs consisting of porches, additions, and devices such as air conditioning unit and water heaters. If new work is carried out such as replacement of gas piping, a plan may be necessary to get the authorization.

And it's always great to get a 2nd and even third  viewpoint prior to you embark on a replacement project. But there are a few ways you can alleviate the cost and trouble of the job.</p>
