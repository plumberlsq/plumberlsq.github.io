<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
