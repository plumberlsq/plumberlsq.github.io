Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.)

For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Due to the fact that pressure is lost during these events, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
