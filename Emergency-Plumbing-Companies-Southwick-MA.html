We have an inspection program to identify water sources and situations that need backflow prevention devices. For home, it is very important for owners to notify the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial home, the District reviews making use of each brand-new tenant.

Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
