<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
