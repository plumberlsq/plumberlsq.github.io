<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may extremely well be part of your task requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which draws in the positively charged minerals in the water (a process known as, ion exchange).

Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
