In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while liquified solids are captured and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover pollutants.</p>

Backflow is the undesirable circulation of water or other liquids, mixes, gasses or compounds into the drinking supply of water. In a lot of states, other than Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your house or business. Atmos Energy does not keep the gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the same as other energies, such as your electrical wiring and pipes.</p>

All major plumbing code bodies attend to protection versus backflow in safe and clean supply of water systems. All potential or existing cross connections should be safeguarded from backflow by the installation of an appropriate backflow prevention device. Consult Public Health for more particular information on code requirements.</p>
