These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply.
