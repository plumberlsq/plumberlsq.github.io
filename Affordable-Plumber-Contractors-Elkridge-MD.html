<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
