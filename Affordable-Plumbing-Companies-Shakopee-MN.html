There are two main sort of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZ) gadgets are most commonly used in commercial centers.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
