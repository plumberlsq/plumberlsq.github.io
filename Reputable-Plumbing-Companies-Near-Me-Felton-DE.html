<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
