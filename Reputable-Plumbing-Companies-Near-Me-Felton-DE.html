It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position.

The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
