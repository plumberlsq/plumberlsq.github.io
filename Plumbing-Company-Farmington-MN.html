<p>Plumbing by Jake has a proven record of 5-star service. We hire just the very best water heater professionals, we appear on time, and we ensure you get exactly what you need-- whether from your current water heater or a new installation. Numerous blockages are caused by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Know how much toilet paper your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever put any paper product into the toilet bowl besides toilet paper. Paper towels can rapidly block the toilet drain line or cause a clog further down the drain. Feminine hygiene products should be disposed of in the trash and never ever in the toilet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with special venting systems also are offered. However they're harder to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
