<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated each year. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked yearly to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.
