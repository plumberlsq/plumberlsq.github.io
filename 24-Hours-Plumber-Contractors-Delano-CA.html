<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
