If you see low water pressure or stained water, it generally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up with time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure.

Constantly continue to run water during and after utilizing your disposal. Preferably, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
