<p>Naturally, it's always simpler to avoid clogs in the first place. Do not overload it if you have a kitchen garbage disposal. Feed items in a little at a time, and wait till they run and grind through entirely prior to adding more. Never put bacon grease, coffee premises or oils down your kitchen drain, and always ensure you run lots of water down the drain after each usage. It is very important to know how to care and maintain for your all your home's plumbing components and systems to keep things running smoothly.</p>
