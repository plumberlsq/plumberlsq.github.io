Like any house device, a toilet tank features lots of small moving parts that may need replaced with use in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
