<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Unionville CT</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
