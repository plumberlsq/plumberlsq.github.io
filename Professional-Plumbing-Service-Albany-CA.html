<p>There are numerous materials used in re-piping, in water supply re-piping a few of the products are metal and possibly some plastic pipes. The metal pipes are galvanized steel or brass, iron, and copper. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec.

Part of the problem is with the fittings that are typically inexpensively made with little quality assurance by a verity of abroad companies. Plastic pipes also have questionable signing up with techniques. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and result in water damage.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
