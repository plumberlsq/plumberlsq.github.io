<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
