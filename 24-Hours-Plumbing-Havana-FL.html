<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to service? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water actually needs it. When needed, newer units use electronic sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow. These more recent systems, likewise described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
