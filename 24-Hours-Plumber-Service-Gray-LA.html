<h3>Best Gas Tankless Water Heater - Indoor Vs. Outdoor Installation in Gray LA</h3>
<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological factors necessitate limiting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride may be suitable. Over time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration process can be arranged automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
