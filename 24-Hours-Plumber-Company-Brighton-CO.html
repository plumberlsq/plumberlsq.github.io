<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the technique set out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
