This decrease in supply pressure takes place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided (such as throughout water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe). Waste disposal unit service warranties last an average of 5 years, but they can vary between 2 and 10 years. Given that the average life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to purchase an extended service warranty.
