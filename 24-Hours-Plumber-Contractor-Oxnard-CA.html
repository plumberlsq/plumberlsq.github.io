<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing business. A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>1. Install a lint-catcher: Your washing machine's water line is responsible for bringing the water out of the machine after it's done washing.

The more of these components you have, the more pricey the job will be. Because the plumber has to replace the secondary drain and inbound lines (see image below) for each plumbing component, that's. Changing the pipes for many plumbing components requires more labor and pipe, which increases cost.</p>
