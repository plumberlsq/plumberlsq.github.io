<p>As soon as the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regenerated.</p>
