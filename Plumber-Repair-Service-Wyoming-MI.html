<p>We specialize in storm drain inspections and cleaning. Softened water is not recommended for watering house yards, gardens and plants due to its salt material. Water used in charging a water softener might overload or decrease the effectiveness of small septic or sewer systems. Salt consumption might pose health dangers.

<p>While the costs to repipe a house differs with each job and throughout the United States, it will generally cost $600 to $2,000 to repipe a single feature (toilet, tub, etc.) and you can expect to pay anywhere from $4,000 to $15,000 for a total piping system replacement. More extreme cross-connection dangers may require an unique kind of backflow preventer that can instantly discharge potentially contaminated water before it enters the general public water system.
