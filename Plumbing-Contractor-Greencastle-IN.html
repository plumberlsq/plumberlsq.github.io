Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would give a price quote over the phone. All of them wished to take a look at the situation before dedicating to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
