<p>This is one of the main and first questions that you should ask yourself when it concerns repiping and changing plumbing in your home.

If your house was developed before the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimum rates if your house was constructed decades prior to that.</p>

<p>Since they can restrain the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never be put down the garbage disposal.
