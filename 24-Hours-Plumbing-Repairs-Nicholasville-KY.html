<p>A brand-new hot water heater will likely last longer, offer you fewer problems, and cost you less to run in time. Slow drains: If you observe that your drains are clearing slower, it could be indicative of the early stages of a clog. A trained plumber would not recommend a replacement unless the initial toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that is the case they might recommend moving toilets to different restrooms to lessen any future stoppages. Hot water heater must be supplied by High 5 Plumbing.</p>
<p>If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run. As an outcome, we recommend changing your system if it is over 10 years old. Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to fix gas leaks yourself.
